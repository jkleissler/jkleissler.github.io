For the 6th and final assignment I created a presentation about the Carolina Panthers with Donnie Miles and Corey Bell. We discussed a brief history of the team, recaped intruguing storylines and statistics from the past season, and a look at what in in store for the team in the near future. I employed the following skills while developing my presentation; HTML5, audio manipulation using audacity, and my presentation skills.
