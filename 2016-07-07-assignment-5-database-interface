title: Assignment 5 Scripting MySQL
---

In the 5th assignment the goal was to practice with writing scripts and storing the user input into a MySQL database that we set up. Incorporating our previous work from task 4, as team Dogwood we scripted user input into a .CSV also known as comma seperated values as to distingish them, or .TSV, substitute commas for tabs, files. The data recorded from task 4 was then loaded it into the MySQL database which we created, outputting a downloadable .sql file. This was done by running our script.
